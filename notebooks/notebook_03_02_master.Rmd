# Getting Started

We are still using the `gss_week3` dataset, and we will be using `ggplot2` and `dplyr` from `tidyverse`. Load the data and `tidyverse`, and remember to include the options to suppress the output, warning, and message from this chunk.

```{r load data and packages, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
gss_week3 <- read.csv("../data/gss_week3.csv")
library(tidyverse)
```

On Monday, we ended class by creating density plots, bar plots, and histograms to visualize the distribution of age at first birth. To warm up, make a bar plot of the education distribution (use the `educ` variable).

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE

```{r education bar plot}
educ_barplot <- ggplot(gss_week3, aes(x = educ))

educ_barplot + geom_bar() + 
     labs(x = "Years of Education",
          y = "Count",
          title = "Distribution of Years of Education",
          subtitle = "GSS, 2000-2014")
```


# Creating Categories

Let's review how we created categories from the `educ` variable to compare distributions. Last class we started with a binary variable distinguishing respondents with college degrees from respondents without college degrees. We can do this with dplyr using mutate() and the ifelse() function. In this example, we'll create a new variable called `college_degree` and we'll put it in the `gss_week3` data frame. 

Note that we have to do this again today because we didn't save it in the data last class, just in the notebook.

```{r create college_degree binary variable}
gss_week3 <- gss_week3 %>%
     mutate(college_degree = ifelse(educ<16, 0, 1))
```

Read the mutate line as:

"Create a new variable called `college_degree`. If the value of the education variable is less than 16, the new variable's value should be 0. If the value of the education variable is anything else, the new variable's value should be 1."

Recall that the mean of a binary variable is the proportion with a 1.

```{r mean of a binary variable is the proportion with a 1}
summary(gss_week3$college_degree)
```

Binary variables are very helpful. For plotting, though, factor variables are often better. We can use mutate() again to assert that we want `college_degree` to be a factor variable, and we will add the `labels = c()` option to label 0 "No" and 1 "Yes".

```{r mutate to factor variable}
gss_week3 <- gss_week3 %>%
     mutate(college_degree = factor(college_degree,
                                    labels = c("No", "Yes")))
```


Now let's make a density plot with two curves: one for respondents without college degrees and one for respondents with college degrees. We will add the `color = ` option to the aesthetic mapping to assert that we want each curve outlined in a different color based on the two values of the `college_degree` variable.

```{r plot with multiple categories}
agekdbrn_college_plot <- ggplot(gss_week3, 
          aes(x = agekdbrn, color = college_degree))

agekdbrn_college_plot + geom_density() +
     labs(x = "Age at First Birth",
          y = "Density",
          title = "Age at First Birth by Education",
          subtitle = "General Social Survey, 2000-2014")
```

There are lots of ways to improve this figure. For example, I might change the fill and alpha of this figure. For other ideas, check out the ggplot2 cheat sheet.

```{r plot with fill and alpha}
agekdbrn_college_plot <- ggplot(gss_week3, 
          aes(x = agekdbrn, 
              color = college_degree, 
              fill = college_degree)) # Fills in the area under the curve

agekdbrn_college_plot + 
     geom_density(alpha = .5) + # Alpha adjusts transparency of 
                                   # overlapping fills
     labs(x = "Age at First Birth",
          y = "Density",
          title = "Age at First Birth by Education",
          subtitle = "General Social Survey, 2000-2014")
```

# More Than Two Categories

New variables can have more than two categories. Their values can also be characters rather than numbers. In this example, we'll create a new variable called `edcat` that puts years of education into the following education categories: "Less Than HS", "HS Diploma", "Some College", "College Degree", and "Grad Prof Degree". How should we cut the values of the `educ` variable to make these categories?

Even though we are creating more than two categories, we can still use `ifelse()` to set them up. The trick is that each "else" condition will open another `ifelse()` function until we are ready to assign remaining observations to the last category.

```{r creating other categories}
gss_week3 <- gss_week3 %>%
     mutate(edcat = ifelse(educ < 12, "Less Than HS",
               ifelse(educ == 12, "HS Diploma",
               ifelse(educ %in% 13:15, "Some College",
               ifelse(educ == 16, "College Degree",
               "Grad Prof Degree")))))
```


What proportion of respondents is in each education category?

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE

```{r}
round(prop.table(table(gss_week3$edcat)),2)
```

The next step is to tell R we will be using this new variable as a factor variable. We do this using `mutate()` as well. We also need to assert the order of the categories, since by default the categories are listed alphabetically. To assert the order, we will add the `levels = c()` option. 

```{r factor variable with levels}
gss_week3 <- gss_week3 %>%
     mutate(edcat = factor(edcat,
               levels = c("Less Than HS",
                     "HS Diploma",
                    "Some College",
                    "College Degree",
                    "Grad Prof Degree")))
```

Let's get a sense of how the distribution of age at first birth varies by education by overlaying density plots of `agekdbrn` for each level of `edcat`. Set everything up in ggplot2 the same way as before (but adjust the title as appropriate; note that `\n` forces a line break in the title). Use `edcat` for our color option so each level of edcat gets a density plot in a different color.

```{r agekdbrn plot by edcat}
agekdbrn_edcat_plot <- ggplot(gss_week3, 
                              aes(x = agekdbrn, 
                                  color = edcat))

agekdbrn_edcat_plot + geom_density() + 
  labs(x = "Age at First Birth", y = "Density", 
     title = "Distribution of Age at First Birth \n by Highest Degree", 
     subtitle = "GSS, 2000-2014")
```

One option to consider at this point is changing the title of the legend. The easiest way to do that is to add `color = ` to the `labs()` function:

```{r agekdbrn edcat plot legend title}
agekdbrn_edcat_plot <- ggplot(gss_week3, aes(x = agekdbrn, color = edcat))

agekdbrn_edcat_plot + geom_density() + 
  labs(x = "Age at \nFirst Birth", y = "Density", 
       title = "Distribution of Age at First Birth \n by Highest Degree",
       subtitle = "GSS, 2000-2014",
       color = "Highest Degree",
       caption = "Note: All densities sum to 1") 
```


## Facets (If There Is Time)

The overlapping plots are quite effective in this case. That's not always true. Another option would be to have a separate plot for each category. You can do that with faceting. In this example, we want to facet into *rows* with `edcat~.`. Note that with faceting you don't need a legend anymore. You can delete it using `guides(color=FALSE)`. 

```{r agekdbrn edcat plot with row facet}
agekdbrn_edcat_plot <- ggplot(gss_week3, aes(x = agekdbrn, color = edcat))

agekdbrn_edcat_plot + geom_density() + 
  labs(x = "Age at First Birth", y = "Density", 
       title = "Distribution of Age at First Birth by Highest Degree", 
       subtitle = "GSS, 2000-2014") +
facet_grid(edcat~.) + guides(color=FALSE)
```

# Delete from class notebook

To change size of text in label "strips":

```{r}
agekdbrn_edcat_plot <- ggplot(gss_week3, aes(x = agekdbrn, color = edcat))

agekdbrn_edcat_plot + geom_density() + 
  labs(x = "Age at First Birth", y = "Density", 
       title = "Distribution of Age at First Birth by Highest Degree", 
       subtitle = "GSS, 2000-2014") +
facet_grid(edcat~.) + guides(color=FALSE) +
theme(strip.text.y = element_text(size = 5))
```


You can facet into columns by replacing `edcat~.` with `.~edcat`. Which would make more sense in this case?

```{r agekdbrn edcat plot with column facet}
agekdbrn_edcat_plot <- ggplot(gss_week3, aes(x = agekdbrn, color = edcat))

agekdbrn_edcat_plot + geom_density() + 
  labs(x = "Age at First Birth", y = "Density", 
       title = "Distribution of Age at First Birth by Highest Degree", 
       subtitle = "GSS, 2000-2014") +
facet_grid(.~edcat)  + guides(color=FALSE)
```

Good rule of thumb: faceting by rows is better when comparing the x axis and faceting by columns is better when comparing the y axis.





# Back to Basics

Let's take a break from graphics for a moment and think about tables and basic summaries again. If you wanted to find the proportion of respondents in each education category for a specific race/ethnicity category (use the `racehisp` variable), what might you do?

```{r}
table(gss_week3$racehisp)
```


### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE
```{r proportion table with indexing}
prop.table(table(gss_week3$edcat
                 [gss_week3$racehisp=="Black"]))
```

Another option would be a cross-tabulation. We set up a cross-tabulation using the same syntax as the `table()` function, but now we'll have two variables separated by a comma. The values of our first variable will become the rows in the table, and the values of the second variable will become the columns. This ordering matters! Think of the row variable as your independent variable (the X) and the column as your dependent variable (the Y). If that's the setup, why would we want the values of `racehisp` to become the rows in this table and the values of `edcat` to become the columns?

```{r table racehisp edcat}
table(gss_week3$racehisp, gss_week3$edcat)
```

How do you think you make a cross-tabulation with proportions?

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE
```{r proportion table racehisp edcat}
round(prop.table(table(gss_week3$racehisp, gss_week3$edcat)),3)
```

By default, these proportions are for the entire table. So the top left cell tells us that 3.2% of all the cases in this data frame are Black respondents who did not complete high school.

To get row proportions, add a comma and a 1 (since the first variable in our table command is the row variable) before closing the prop.table parentheses. 

```{r prop table row proportions}
round(prop.table(table(gss_week3$racehisp, gss_week3$edcat),1),3)
```

Each *row* in the above table sums to 1. To get column proportions, replace the 1 with a 2. In the table below, each *column* should sum to 1. In general, we'll use row proportions more than column proportions.

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE
```{r prop table column proportions}
round(prop.table(table(gss_week3$racehisp, gss_week3$edcat),2),3)
```

There are a couple other `dplyr` functions that help with finding values of one variable for all values of another variable. For example, we might want to find the mean age at first birth for each race/ethnicity category. To do so, we first need to name a new data frame where we will store our values. Then we group all the observations by the categorical variable. Then we create a variable for our new data frame that summarizes one variable for all the categories of our other variable. And we can connect these functions with pipes.

```{r group by and summarize means}
agekdbrn_racehisp <- gss_week3 %>% 
     group_by(racehisp) %>% # We want info about each level of this variable
     summarize(mean_agekdbrn = mean(agekdbrn)) # The info we want

agekdbrn_racehisp
```

This `summarize()` function works with a lot of the basic commands we have discussed (min, max, sd, var, etc.). Try finding the median age at first birth for each education category. You can still use the `agekdbrn_edcat` object:

### REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR CODE
```{r}
agekdbrn_edcat <- gss_week3 %>% 
                  group_by(edcat) %>% 
                  summarize(median_agekdbrn = median(agekdbrn))

agekdbrn_edcat
```

```{r}
test_1 <- ggplot(agekdbrn_edcat, aes(x = edcat, 
                                     y = median_agekdbrn,
                                fill = edcat))

test_1 + geom_col() + geom_text(aes(label = median_agekdbrn))
```
