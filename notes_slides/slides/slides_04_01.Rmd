# Assignment 3 Recap - Question 3

## Create a new factor variable for hours worked with the following categories: less than 20, 20-39, 40, more than 40. The levels should be in order from least to most hours.

--

```{r}

  c("Race/Hisp", "Std Dev Hours")

# Measures of Association

### Last week: Describing two categorical variables

--

### This week: Describing relationship between two numerical variables

--

### Remember a hypothesis: How variables *tend to move together*

--

- How close or tight are the values? How well do they resemble a straight line?

--

- The spread they tend to share = covariance

--

- The change they tend to share = correlation

---

# Interpreting Correlations

### Easier to interpret correlations than covariances

--

- Always bounded by -1, 1

--

- Association is linear (for now)

--

- Positive correlation > 0

--

     - When X is larger than its mean, likely that Y is larger than its mean

--

- Negative correlation < 0

--

     - When X is larger than its mean, unlikely that Y is larger than its mean

---

# Interpreting Correlations 

### Correlation of X, Y = Correlation of Y, X

--

- But still think of axes

--

### Not affected by changes in scale

--

- Can multiply all the values by a constant and the correlation is still the same
- Temperature degrees, currencies, etc. 

--

### But can be affected by outliers

---

# Strength of Association

### Positive correlation coefficients look like proportions but they are not

--

### Strong association: knowing a value of one variable helps predict a value of the other variable

--

### Weak association: too much variability to use the value of one variable to make a good guess about the value of the other variable 

--

### Remember: Not causal!

--

### Keep in mind: *strong* is not always *better*

---

# Strength of Associations

### No association = 0 to .19 or 0 to -.19

### Weak association = .20 to .29 or -.20 to -.29

### Moderate association = .30 to .49 or -.30 to -.49

### Strong association = .50 to .69 or -.50 to -.69

### Very strong association = greater than .70 or less than -.70

# An Example: Chetty et al (2014)

### Comparing income mobility rates across regions

--

### Regional variation across 741 "Commuting Zones"
- Cover all counties (not just metropolitan statistical areas)
- We are in the Burlington, VT commuting zone

--

### Tax data from parents of 6.3 million children born in 1980-1
- Identify CZ and parent's income when child was age 16
- Compare to child's income around age 30

--

### "Mobility" = the average income rank in the children's income distribution for children who grew up at the 25th percentile in the parent's income distribution

---

# An Example: Chetty et al (2014)

![:scale 90%](385_figures/chetty_correlations.png)

---

# Explaining Regional Variation

--

### Three-quarters of variance in absolute upward mobility explained by five factors:

--

- Gini coefficient for bottom 99%

--

- Social capital index (voter turnout, community participation, returning census forms, etc.)

--

- Proportion of children living in single-parent households

--

- High school dropout rate adjusted for family income

--

- Proportion of workers who commute 15 minutes or less
